Surf Shelter Model Training Module v0

The Surf Shelter Model Training Module v0 is designed to enhance the Surf Shelter platform's capabilities through machine learning.
Key aspects include:

- Data Collection: Utilizes approximately 1,000 URLs from the Common Crawl dataset to gather diverse web data.

- Feature Extraction: Employs the Features Processor Engine to derive attributes such as URL length, domain age, 
and reputation scores for each URL.

- Data Augmentation: In the absence of real-time data, generates synthetic feature values using randomization techniques 
to simulate realistic scenarios.

- Model Training: Implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, trained on the synthetic dataset, 
to predict the likelihood of a URL being malicious.

- Evaluation: Assesses the SVM model's performance using metrics like accuracy and classification reports to ensure reliability.

- Integration: Plans to incorporate the trained model into the Surf Shelter platform, aiming to enhance security measures and user experience.
